# About
Crystal Coast is a light-weight framework written in SASS. It's inspired by Bootstrap, but contains
much fewer features. It's intended for smaller web applications and personal use.

# Instalation
You can download the source from github and compile it with SASS, or use download the raw compiler
ready to use css file (crystal-coast-min.css).
To support some advanced features, you need to include file crystal-coast-min.js (which requires jQuery)
